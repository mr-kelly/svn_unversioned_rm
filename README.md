Script to delete svn unversioned files


# oh yeah!

Revert SVN(Subversion) unversioned files is not a easy work!

I use this script to delete all unversioned files.


Because I want it to work in Windows , Mac, Linux. So I use Python.

Also you can pass some --ignores pattern to it.

This script use `svn` command



Exmaple:

svn_unversioned_rm.bat some/svn/path  --ignores ignorefoldername
